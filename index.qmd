## Practical workbook: Data handling

This page links to the **FB2NRP data handling workbook**.

Most of you will arrive here from **Blackboard**.  
To work through the practical in Google Colab:

1. **Click the Colab badge** below.  
2. A new browser tab will open with the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
3. If Google shows a warning about running code from GitHub, you can **safely ignore it and continue** – this is our teaching material.

You may also download the notebook and run it locally in Jupyter if you prefer.
