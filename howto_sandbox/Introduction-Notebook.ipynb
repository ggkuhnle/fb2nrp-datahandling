        "\n",
        "Think of **OOP** as a way to bundle **data** and the **things you can do with that data** into one unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Core ideas (mapped to our example)\n",
        "- **Class** → a **blueprint** that defines what data an object has and what it can do.  \n",
        "  *Example:* `Hippo` is the blueprint.\n",

        "- **Attributes** → the **data** an object stores.  \n",
        "  *Example:* `self.name`, `self.favourite_food`.\n",
        "- **Methods** → the **behaviours** (functions) an object can perform.  \n",
        "  *Example:* `introduce()`, `eat(food)`.\n",
        "- **`__init__`** → the **constructor**: runs when you create a new object, initialising its attributes.\n",
        "- **`self`** → the current object; it lets methods access the object’s own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why OOP can be useful\n",
        "- **Encapsulation:** keep related data and actions together (tidy, easier to reason about).\n",
        "- **Reusability:** create many objects from one blueprint (e.g., lots of hippos with different names).\n",
        "- **Extensibility:** add new methods or attributes later without breaking existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Reading the Hippo example\n",
        "- The class defines what every hippo **has** (`name`, `favourite_food`) and what every hippo **does** (`introduce`, `eat`).\n",
        "- When we write `h = Hippo(\"Hildegard\", ...)`, Python calls `__init__` to set up that object’s data.\n",
        "- Calling `h.eat(\"cabbage\")` runs the `eat` **method** *on that object’s data* (via `self`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### When should you use OOP here?\n",
        "For most FB2NEP notebooks, **functions + data frames** are enough.  \n",
