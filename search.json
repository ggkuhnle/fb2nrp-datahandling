    "text": "1 0. What does Python code look like?\n\n\nWhat is Python?\n\nPython is a popular, general-purpose programming language known for being readable, beginner-friendly, and widely used in science, data analysis, and education.\nKey points - Easy to read: clear, English-like syntax; indentation (spacing) shows structure. - Interpreted: you run code line-by-line (great for notebooks and exploration). - “Batteries included”: comes with many built-in tools; huge ecosystem of libraries. - Cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux; also runs in the cloud (Colab).\nWhy we use it in FB2NEP - Excellent libraries for data work: NumPy (numbers), pandas (tables), Matplotlib (plots). - Integrates smoothly with Jupyter/Colab, so you can mix code + text + results. - Perfect for transparent, reproducible analysis.\nDo I need to be a programmer? No. You’ll use short, explained snippets to explore concepts. You’re learning with code, not learning to code per se.\nWhich version? We use Python 3 (the modern standard). Colab already provides it; local users can install it via Miniconda/Anaconda or venv.\nTiny example:\nprint(\"Hello from Python!\")\n\nPython is a set of instructions written line by line.\nAnything after a # on a line is a comment — it’s for humans to read and Python ignores it.\nExample:\n# This is a comment — it explains the next line\nx = 2 + 3            # ← comment at the end of a line\nprint(x)             # prints 5 on the screen\nYou run code by clicking the little ▶ button to the left of a cell, or by pressing Shift + Enter.\n\nIf you see a warning like “This notebook was not authored by Google”, click Run anyway.\nColab runs code safely in the cloud and won’t change anything on your computer.\n\n\n1.1 Python has commands and data\nWhen you run a cell, Python executes commands (instructions) that act on data (values).\n\nCommands: things like print(...), len(...), sum(...), or your own functions.\n\nData: numbers, text, lists, tables, etc., usually stored in variables (names you choose).\n\nTiny example:\nname = \"Fiona\"       # data (text)\nn = 3                # data (number)\nprint(\"Hello\", name) # command acting on data\nprint(\"n + 2 =\", n + 2)\n\n\n1.2 What do we mean by “data”?\nData are the values your code works with. Common kinds you’ll see here:\n\nNumbers: 3, 2.5 (counts, measurements)\nText (strings): \"apple\", \"F\" (labels, categories)\nBooleans: True / False (yes/no flags)\nLists: [\"Mon\",\"Tue\",\"Wed\"], [2, 1, 3] (ordered collections)\nDictionaries: {\"age\": 10, \"height_cm\": 140} (named pieces of data)\nTables (pandas DataFrame): spreadsheet-like rows & columns for analysis\n\nMini examples:\nage = 10                           # number\nfruit = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]        # list of text\nheights = {\"Alex\":150, \"Sam\":146}  # dictionary\nIn FB2NEP we mostly use numbers, text labels, and tables (pandas DataFrame) because they map naturally to real datasets (participants × variables). You will also encounter missing values (shown as NaN) — that simply means “no recorded value”."

If you install into one environment but run a notebook with a different kernel, imports will fail.\n\nCommon libraries in FB2NEP - NumPy (import numpy as np) — fast maths and arrays. - pandas (import pandas as pd) — tables (DataFrames), reading CSV/Excel, tidying. - Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt) — plots and figures.\nTypical workflow 1) (If needed) install\npython    # In notebooks, prefer %pip so it targets the current kernel    %pip -q install numpy pandas matplotlib 2) Import python    import numpy as np    import pandas as pd    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 3) Use python    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])    df = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": [1, 2, 3]})    plt.plot(df[\"x\"]); plt.show()\n\nColab note: many libraries are already installed. If you install new ones, Runtime → Restart runtime and re-run the notebook from the top.\n\nExample: how to use libraries.\n\n# Quick library demo (imports + versions)\nimport numpy as np, pandas as pd, matplotlib\nprint(\"NumPy:\", np.__version__)\nprint(\"pandas:\", pd.__version__)\nprint(\"Matplotlib:\", matplotlib.__version__)\n\n\n\n3.2 3. Variables: storing and using information\nA variable is a named container that holds a piece of information — such as text, numbers, or data.\nYou can give variables meaningful names (e.g. name, year) and then use them in commands.\nIn this example: - name = \"Jessica\" assigns a piece of text (called a string) to the variable name. - year = datetime.now().year automatically retrieves the current year from your computer or Colab environment. - print(\"Hello\", name, \"— welcome to FB2NEP\", year) combines both variables in one output line.\nVariables make your code flexible — if you change name, the message updates automatically.\n\n# ----------------------------------------------\n# Say hello with variables\n# ----------------------------------------------\nfrom datetime import datetime   # import module to get current date/time\nname = \"Jessica\"            # a text value (a 'string')\nyear = datetime.now().year  # a number\nprint(\"Hello\", name, \"— welcome to FB2NEP\", year)   # show something on the screen"

It can hold numbers, text, or a mixture of both, and is written inside square brackets [ ], with items separated by commas.\nIn this example, we have a small list of numbers representing, for instance, the number of fruit portions eaten by four participants.\nWe then use a few built-in functions to calculate basic descriptive statistics:\n\nsum(nums) — adds up all numbers in the list.\n\nlen(nums) — counts how many items are in the list (its length).\n\ntotal / n — divides the total by the number of items to obtain the mean (average).\n\nprint(...) — displays the results clearly below the cell.\n\nYou can change the numbers, re-run the cell, and observe how the total and mean change accordingly.\n\n# ----------------------------------------------\n# List of numbers — total and mean\n# ----------------------------------------------\nnums = [3, 5, 8, 12]  # a list: an ordered box of values\ntotal = sum(nums)     # sum() adds up numbers\nn     = len(nums)     # Length of list = number of observations\nmean = total / n      # average = total divided by how many\nprint(\"Numbers:\", nums)\nprint(\"Total:\", total, \"Observations:\", n, \"Mean:\", mean)"

I like {self.favourite_food}.\")\n\n  # Another behaviour\n  def eat(self, food):\n    if food == self.favourite_food:\n      print(f\"Yum! {self.name} loves {food}. 🦛\")\n    else:\n      print(f\"{self.name} tries {food}… not bad!\")\n\n# Make an object (an instance) from the class\nh = Hippo(\"Hildegard\", favourite_food=\"lotus leaves\")\nh.introduce()      # call a method\nh.eat(\"lotus leaves\")\nh.eat(\"cabbage\")"

Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Colab is especially well suited to machine learning, data science, and education.\n\n\nRight-clicking will open Colab in a new browser window.\n\n\nClick an Open in Colab button above. Colab will load the notebook from GitHub.\nAt the top‑right, click Connect if it isn’t already connected. This starts a fresh, temporary Python session (a “runtime”).\n\nYou may see a warning like “This notebook was not authored by Google.”\n\nClick Run anyway. Our notebooks are plain text and safe to run.\n\n\nYou might also see “Warning: This notebook requires permissions to run.”\n\nClick Run anyway. Colab sandboxes code; nothing runs on your computer.\n\n\nTo run a cell, click the small ▶ button on its left, or press Shift + Enter.\n\nTo run every cell from top to bottom, go to Runtime → Run all.\n\nTo save your own editable copy, go to File → Save a copy in Drive. You now have a personal copy you can edit freely.\n\n\n2.1 Useful Colab options\n\nRuntime → Restart runtime resets the session if things get stuck.\n\nRuntime → Change runtime type (we use Python 3; no GPU needed).\n\nFile → Download lets you save the executed notebook as .ipynb or PDF."
