    "# FB2NEP Workbook 3 – Populations, Samples, and Representativeness\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 0.1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook introduces core ideas in sampling for nutritional epidemiology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distinction between the **general population**, a **study's target population**, and the realised **sample**.\n",
    "- The notions of **sampling frames**, **representativeness**, and **sampling error** versus **bias**.\n",
    "- How a **probability sample** such as NHANES can be used as a reference for population structure.\n",
    "- How to compare simple descriptive statistics between a **reference population** (NHANES) and a **study cohort** (the FB2NEP synthetic dataset).\n",
    "- How **sample size** affects the precision of estimates of central tendency (here: body mass index, BMI).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)**: a large, nationally representative survey of the non-institutionalised United States population. Here we download a small subset of NHANES 2017–2018 directly from the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov) via a helper script.\n",
    "- **FB2NEP synthetic cohort**: the synthetic dataset that we use throughout the module for regression and causal reasoning. Here it plays the role of a *study sample* that we compare to NHANES.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hippo cameo: imagine a very diligent hippo who always volunteers for nutrition surveys. This will help us think about who actually ends up in a sample.\n"
